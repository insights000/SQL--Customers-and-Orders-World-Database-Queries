**Overview**
This task reflects my SQL skills to write simple queries to retrieve information from the world and customers and orders databases that we were assigned during this project in the Level Data Technician Bootcamp. The task consisted of SQL Task Assignments One which asked me to write queries of the customers and orders database, then producing an entity relationship diagram outlining how the primary key and foreign keys and assets were connected across each of the tables in the relational database management system. The second task was similar and involved the worlds database retrieving and writing queries for the database in regards to countries and customer orders and producing a second entity relationship diagram outlining the usage and understanding of practical application and the theoretical application of relational database management systems.
